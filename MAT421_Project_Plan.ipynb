        "Diabetes is a disease that occurs when blood sugar levels are high from a lack of insulin production. This disease affects many people around the world and detecting it early on could prevent long-term issues. The first step in catching diabetes is understanding the factors/variables that correlate to the development of this disease. Our main objective is to create a model using various features to predict the presence of any early stages of diabetes for an individual. This could help with early detection and diagnosis for those who are prone to this disease."

However, there has been less exploration of simpler models, such as multiple linear regression, which has the benefit of being easy to interpret and implement. This project fills that gap by examining how accurately multiple linear regression can predict diabetes.\n"

The model will be trained on popular features such as glucose levels, BMI, and age (for example), with diabetes progression as the target variable."

The experiment will be implemented using scikit-learn, and key steps like data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation will be documented in Jupyter notebooks through Colab."

Key features like glucose levels and BMI (for example) are likely to be significant predictors. However, the modelâ€™s simplicity may limit its ability to capture non-linear relationships. That is also the reason why most of the related works used more complex models, not linear regression. But again, we expect the model to perform well enough to see if it could be used as an option to apply into the data and machine learning in the future.\n",
